## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains all survey data used in the project.
  - **raw/**: Original, unprocessed survey data files.
	- **processed/**: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data cleaning and processing.
- **interviews/**: Survey/interview questions and participant responses.
- **images/**: Visual assets for reports and presentations.
- **references/**: Academic papers and reference materials.
- **old_versions/**: Previous versions of proposals and documents.

## Key Files
